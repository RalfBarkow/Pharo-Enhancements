Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance talks about an ideal where static (conservative, traditional, keep things as they are) and dynamic (progress, experimentation, evolution) form a feedback loop where the good parts of the last tevolution become fixed as a static foundation for the next dynamic leap. Unfortunately, in practice we seem to only have the extremes available: the static last century ideas behind Windows and Mac and a steady stream of papers, theories and experiments from the real visionaries (cough, not Steve Jobs, the real ones). I realize that the model of the latter is cathedral building and shortening the hundreds of years from printing press to saddle-sized books, but I can't help but think that leaving a trail of usable artifacts would bring so many more people on board, playing and creating with something real. When I discovered Squeak, I got right to work with my new Dynabook, but the Morphic clean up that never happened quickly crushed my dreams of any Blue Plane ideas and I went back to hibernation waiting for a cleanup, and then Morphic 3 which was never integrated and then Frankenstein which was never publicly available for use and now Bloc which seems frought with political controversy... - 4/24/2020 on {{gtWikiPage:SqueakReunion}}.\r"
